    To make dosa, start by washing the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds (if using). Soak them together in water for about 4-6 hours or overnight. Once soaked, drain the water and blend the mixture into a smooth batter, adding water as needed to achieve a slightly runny consistency. Let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours, or until it doubles in size and becomes slightly tangy.
    
    Once the batter is ready, heat a non-stick or cast-iron griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with oil or ghee. Pour a ladle of the batter onto the center of the griddle and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer. Cook the dosa for a few minutes until the edges begin to lift, then drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges. Once crispy and golden brown, fold the dosa and serve hot with coconut chutney and sambar for a delicious meal.
